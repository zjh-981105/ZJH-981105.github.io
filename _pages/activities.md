Beyond academic research, I am actively involved in social service and environmental protection. Here are some highlights of my journey.

## 🌲 Environmental Protection: Desertification Control
**Volunteer | Minqin, Gansu | [cite_start]Apr. 2025** [cite: 82, 84]

I participated in the "Come to Minqin to Plant a Tree" public welfare activity. In the Tengger Desert, I worked with teammates to plant saxaul trees to prevent desertification. We also produced short videos to raise public awareness about ecological protection.
