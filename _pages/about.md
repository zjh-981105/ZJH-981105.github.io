**Hello! I am Jinghui Zhao (赵景辉).**

I am a Master of Management candidate in **Agricultural Economics & Management** at [Northeast Agricultural University (NEAU)](https://www.neau.edu.cn/), China. 

My research approach is defined by an **interdisciplinary perspective**. [cite_start]With a solid foundation in **Human Geography** (B.Sc.) and **Law** (LL.B.), I analyze rural development issues through the combined lens of spatial economics, policy mechanisms, and quantitative evaluation.

### 🔬 Research Interests
[cite_start]My current research focuses on **Rural Development**, **Rural Development**,**Green Agricultural Development**,**Rural Education**,**Smart City Construction**, and **Rural Revitalization** in China. [cite_start]I am particularly interested in how digital technologies empower agricultural and rural sectors to foster green development, as well as investigating the dynamics of urban-rural educational inequality.

### 🛠️ Methodological Approach
I believe in data-driven research grounded in extensive fieldwork. My toolkit includes:
* [cite_start]**Econometric Modeling:** Using **Stata** and **DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis)** to measure efficiency and identify influencing factors.
* [cite_start]**Spatial Analysis:** Utilizing **ArcGIS** and **Geodetector** to visualize spatial patterns and regional disparities.
* [cite_start]**Policy Analysis:** Applying **NVivo** for quantitative text analysis of agricultural policies.
* [cite_start]**Programming:** **Python** (Matplotlib) and **MATLAB** for simulation and visualization.

### 🌟 Highlights
* [cite_start]**Key Projects:** Core member of the *National Social Science Fund* projects, focusing on building leading agricultural provinces and evaluating grain production pathways.
* [cite_start]**Fieldwork:** Led large-scale investigations in Heilongjiang, designing questionnaires and coordinating data collection from over 1000 households and government bodies.
* [cite_start]**Service:** I served as a team leader for the *Voluntary Service Program for Western Regions*, teaching in China's border areas for one year.

I am actively looking for Ph.D. opportunities where I can further explore the intersection of agricultural economics and spatial planning.
